# Castle Defense Idle
Defense your castle in this basic idle style RPG! Inspried by classic Role-playing Games(RPGs) and modern idle games, Castle Defense Idle is a simple idle game with auto and click targeting. **This game functions the best played in full-screen!** If you're having trouble targeting you can also click the monster's name.

## Sprites
Sprites(characters in the game) were created using Canvas, and each sprite image is a sheet of images that is iterated over using the height, width, the number of columns, and the number of rows to get the desire position of the sprite.

[Superpowers](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/superpowers "Superpowers Homepage") by Sparklinlabs for all the images and used in this project! 

Each sprite has a different strength attack speed. For example, the archer's attack speed is higher than the warrior, but his strength is lower. The same applies for the enemy sprites with the enemies on the last stage dealing massive damage, be careful! Enemies have a chance to miss the player sprites, and the chance to miss increases as player sprites are defeated.

This game was bulit for easy addition of sprites in the future by using object orientated functions. Only the specifications of the sprite image sheet is needed, customize the sprite strength and speed, and the sprite is ready to battle!
## Targeting and Special Abilities
### Targeting
While this is an idle game with auto targeting, the player is able to select a target for strategy by clicking on the monster image **_if played in full-screen_** or by clicking on the enemy sprite's name.

### Special Abilities
There are two abilites that each have a cooldown on use. A group attack the massively damages all enemies, and a group heal that heals a certain precentage of the player sprite's health points(HP). **When the ability is ready the bar will begin flashing!**
